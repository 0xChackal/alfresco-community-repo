1. Get the share application URL by running these commands:

IP=$(minikube ip)
PORT=$(kubectl get services {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx-ingress-controller -o jsonpath={.spec.ports[0].nodePort})
echo "http://$IP:$PORT/share"

2. To access Repository go to /alfresco path with the same base URL
3. To access Solr go to /solr path with the same base URL

4. If you deployed on an AWS cluster you can get the route53 entry for the cluster as follows:

DNSNAME=$(kubectl get services {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx-ingress-controller -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname})
echo "http://$DNSNAME/share"

5. Note: if you deployed on a different namespace than the default one, then the kubectl commands should also specify the namespace to run in with --namespace

6. Depending on the storage you use for volumes you should be able to access the persisted db data in the following locations:
    - On minikube the usual location is /tmp/hostpath-provisioning
    - With docker-for-desktop the usual location is /Users/YourUser/.docker/Volumes/
