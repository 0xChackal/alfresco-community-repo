1. Get the share application URL by running these commands:

IP=$(minikube ip)
PORT=$(kubectl get services {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx-ingress-controller -o jsonpath={.spec.ports[0].nodePort})
echo "http://$IP:$PORT/share"

2. To access Repository go to /alfresco path with the same base URL
3. To access Solr go to /solr path with the same base URL

4. If you deployed on an AWS cluster you can get the route53 entry for the cluster as follows:

DNSNAME=$(kubectl get services {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx-ingress-controller -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname})
echo "http://$DNSNAME/share"

5. Note: if you deployed on a different namespace than the default one, then the kubectl commands should also specify the namespace to run in with --namespace

6. Persistent Storage

Depending on the storage you use for volumes you should be able to access the persisted db data in the following locations:
    - On minikube the usual location is /tmp/hostpath-provisioning
    - With docker-for-desktop the usual location is /Users/YourUser/.docker/Volumes/

If you choose to use EFS for persistence keep in mind that the persistent volume created has the ReclaimPolicy set to Recycle.
This means that by default, when you delete the release the saved data is deleted automatically.

To change this behaviour and keep the data you can set the persistence.reclaimPolicy value to Retain.

For more Information on Reclaim Policies checkout the official K8S documentation here -> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reclaim-policy
