# README

Repository is a work in progress and is temporary. It will be deleted. Please do not clone it.

It is an attempt to combine a number of existing community projects to make development of the repository component
simpler. It creates an alfresco.war and an alfresco/alfresco-community-repo-base docker image that contains no other
ACS components. A branch of acs-community-packaging is also being changed so that dependency management flows from
this project to the packaging and AMP projects.

## Project versions
